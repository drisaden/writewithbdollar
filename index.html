                    Before I tell you how he did it. Here's a little story about him
                </p>
                <p class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest">
                    He's a student of the University of Uyo and there was a time
                    he nearly dropped out of school because of lack of money to
                    finance his schooling.</p>
                <p class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest">

                    As a young serious person from a poor family, he started
                    looking for means to survive just like everybody and he
                    stumbled upon an opportunity to write for Brands,
                    Individuals, and Businesses, both home and abroad.</p> 
                    <p
                    class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest">
                    He explored the opportunity to an extent that he was
                    consistently making $1500 and above monthly. Then the idea
                    of saving the drowning writers who keep writing for meagre
                    pay struck his mind, he created this new opportunity (that you're going to learn in the <b>Whatsapp Training</b>) and so he began
                    to teach people how to do the same thing that he did.</p>
                    <p class="p-5 leading-10 tracking-widest italic text-xl font-bold pop-font">Below are some of TESTIMONIALS of over 6 thousand students who has benefited from this new opportunity.</p>
